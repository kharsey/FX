DATA

The data used in this paper are described in Section 3 in the
article  and in the Data Appendix  (Section 2 of the online appendix BKKS_appendix.pdf).
If you use these data, please refer to the original data providers.  
See Section 2 of the online appendix BKKS_appendix.pdf
for information about the original data sources.   

Data are in the following CSV (MS-DOS) files:

Variable(s)                                                  File name

EXCHANGE RATES                                    exrate.csv
UIP                                                               uip.csv
INT_DIFF                                                     idiff.csv
STOCK_GROWTH                                       stockg.csv
OIL                                                               oil.csv
INTEREST RATES                                      int.csv
FXVOL                                                         fxvol.csv
VIX                                                               vix.csv

The data sample ranges from 1973:01 to 2016:12 for the exchange rates,
1986:06 to 2016:12 for VIX, 1993:01 to 2016:12 for FXVOL  
and from 1986:01 to 2016:12 for the reamining variables.

MATLAB CODES

With main.m the econometric model can be generated and results evaluated.

The folder "functions" contains routines that are necessary to execute main.m:

construct_model_index.m       Construct matrix with all possible model specifications
mlag2.m                                     Generate lagged Y matrix
create_RHS.m                           Create RHS of VAR model
create_RHS_xx_2.m                  Add asset-specific predictors to the RHS
create RHS_xxx.m                    Add non asset-specific predictors to the RHS
nearestSPD.m                           Find nearest symmetric positive definite matrix  
tvpvarprior.m                             Set up the prior 
Minnesota_prior_flexible.m    Construct Minnesota prior mean and covariance matrix
